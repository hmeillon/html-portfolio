<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is HÃ©ctor Meillon, I'm a Mexican web developer, since 2023.
  Originally I've studied Customs and Logistics, but I knew that that wasn't for me, I've always be passionate about tech,
  including web developing, programming, robotics, videogames and spacial things like SpaceX (I love to watch rockets launching too!).

  Since I was a kid I was always curious, playing with my toys in different ways, exploring my house, watching little bugs and animals being alive
  was one of my favorite things. Also, when I was young, I've dreamed to become an astronaut, it was really intriguing to know how how the space is,
  and to date, I'm really intrigued and really want to go to space.

  With the years, I discovered many other things, like art, maths, cuisine, and many others, but tech was always in my blood. I love to help
  others to solve their problems and achieve things and goals, but also, achieve my own goals.
