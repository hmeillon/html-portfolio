<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<p>Heres a list of my all-time favorite movies and a poem for each one of them.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Toy Story</h3>
<p>Toy Story has been my all-time favorite movie, the first 3D animated picture in the world.</p>
<p>
Be passionate young one,<br />
just like Sheriff Woody.<br />
Don't nibble when you can gobble.<br />
Don't dawdle when you can skidaddle.<br />
</p>

<h3>Get Out!</h3>
<p>One of my favorite horror movie. Great actors and plot.</p>
<p>
From that sky livid, bizarre<br />
as your tortured destiny,<br />
what thoughts fill your empty heart,<br />
Freethinker, answer me.<br />
</p>

<h3>El Orfanato</h3>
<p>One of my favorite horror movies with one of my favorite movie directors, Guillermo del Toro.</p>
<p>
I turn my head but I see nothing<br />
You fool, they've takken your eyes<br />
With that, the blood comes rushing<br />
These humans worship lies<br />
There is a voice in my head and in the end they'll all be dead.<br />
